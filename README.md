Module 2 VBA solution code

## Project Overview

-Refactor Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data

## Results

**2017** 
- Total daily volume produced mostly positive results excluding TERP which produduced negative results
- Code ran in 0.8515625 seconds for the year

**2018** 
- Total daily volume produced mostly negative results excluding ENPH and RUN which produced negative results
- Code ran in 0.84375 seconds for the year

## Summary
1. Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
    - Advantages
     - Saves time typing out repetitive code
     - Mainainability if code is organized
    - Disadvantage
     - Creates potention typing errors for hard-coded text
     - It's risky when using large codes that hasn't been properly tests
2. > How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
[^1]: Unsure if this is the same as question one and you need more detail or you want me to detail pros cons from the original VBA script

[^1a]: Detailing my answer to question 1 
    - Pros: Organizing refactored code provides maintainability and extensibility, giving the user the ability to change and update the code as need. 
    - Cons: However if the code is not organized and readable you could run into errors or outdated code

[^1b]: Identifing erros / inconsistencies in refactoring original VBA script 
    - Pros:Comparing the VBA script with the script created during the module helpped organize the script in the final script.
    - Cons: Differences in Challenge_Starter_Code vs the code created throughout the module created confusion with what does and does work. Similarly the instructions in the instructions on the Module 2 Challenge also differ. For example tickerVolumes vs tickerVolume, I'm assuming the spelling and indentation diferences is irelivant. When working with excel the correct spelling and placement of formulas are detrimental to producing the correct results.
